# Introduction

**What is Nine?**

**Nine** - _(Nethermind Intelligent Nodes Environment)_ is a framework for building AI agents. The goal is to make it easy to create, deploy, and update a mesh of distributed AI agents. ⚡

At the heart of the framework are these technologies:

- **Rust** – Agents run on their own multi-threaded runtime, so they don’t need Python or JavaScript virtual machines.
- **P2P (Peer-to-Peer)** – Agents can be made up of multiple nodes connected in a mesh network. This means your AI system can reshape itself and add new components whenever needed!
- **Transactional Actors** – Agents are built using transactional actors, which help create resilient, failure-proof components. This keeps your code clean and organized—no more messy async spaghetti.
- **No-Code UI** – No need to build a UI from scratch! The system automatically generates an interface based on what your distributed agent can do.
